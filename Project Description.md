The project is a website designed to analyze other websites (identified by their URLs) 
for accessibility issues. It specifically focuses on compliance with WCAG 2.1 
(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) standards.

The key features and capabilities are:

1. Automated Scanning & Machine Learning:
   It uses a combination of automated scanning
   techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect accessibility problems.
   This suggests a two-pronged approach: standard automated checks (likely using axe-core,
   which is listed in the technologies) and more advanced, possibly pattern-based, detection
   through machine learning (using TensorFlow.js).

2. Real-time Visualization Dashboards:
   The results of the analysis, including critical accessibility metrics, are displayed on
   interactive dashboards. D3.js is used for these visualizations, indicating sophisticated
   graphical representations of data.

3. AI-Powered Remediation Suggestions:
   Beyond just identifying issues, the system offers AI-driven advice on how to fix them,
   even providing code snippets.  

4. Disability Experience Simulation:
   This is a standout feature that allows users to simulate how people with different 
   disabilities might experience the website being analyzed.

5. RESTful API Architecture: The project includes a RESTful API. This is significant because
   it allows other systems or developers to programmatically access the analysis capabilities.

   5.1. CI/CD Pipeline Integration: The API enables the tool to be integrated into Continuous
        Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines, meaning accessibility checks can be
        automated as part of the software development lifecycle.
   5.2. Longitudinal Analytics: The API also supports tracking accessibility improvements
        over time, allowing organizations to monitor their progress.
