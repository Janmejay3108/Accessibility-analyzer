

**Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Backend Setup**

1.  **Project Initialization & Version Control:**
    *   Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    *   Create a `README.md` with a project overview.
    *   Set up a `.gitignore` file (e.g., for `node_modules`, `.env` files, build artifacts).
2.  **Backend Setup (Node.js & Express):**
    *   Initialize a Node.js project (`npm init -y`).
    *   Install Express.js (`npm install express`).
    *   Create a basic server structure (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`).
    *   Set up initial folders: `routes`, `controllers`, `models`.
3.  **Database Setup (Firebase/Firestore):**
    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    *   Set up Firestore database in the Firebase project.
    *   Install Firebase Admin SDK (`npm install firebase-admin`) for server-side operations.
    *   Configure Firebase authentication and Firestore security rules.
    *   Connect the Express app to Firebase/Firestore.
4.  **Basic API Endpoint for URL Input:**
    *   Create an API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/analyze`) that accepts a URL.
    *   Implement basic validation for the URL.
    *   Store the analysis request in Firestore.

**Phase 2: Core Automated Scanning**

5.  **Integrate `axe-core`:**
    *   Install `axe-core` (`npm install axe-core`).
    *   Install a browser automation library like Playwright (`npm install playwright`) to run `axe-core` on the given URL in a headless browser environment.
    *   Develop a backend service/module that:
        *   Takes a URL.
        *   Launches Playwright to open the URL (potentially specifying a browser like Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit).
        *   Injects and runs `axe-core` on the page.
        *   Retrieves the `axe-core` results.
6.  **Process and Store Scan Results:**
    *   Design Firestore document structure to store `axe-core` results (violations, passes, incomplete, inapplicable) linked to the analysis request.
    *   Update the `/api/analyze` endpoint to trigger the `axe-core` scan after saving the initial request.
    *   Store the retrieved results in Firestore collections.

**Phase 3: Basic Frontend & Initial Results Display**

7.  **Frontend Setup (React.js):**
    *   Create a React application (e.g., using `create-react-app` or Vite) in a `client` or `frontend` sub-directory.
    *   Set up basic project structure (components, services, views/pages).
8.  **UI for URL Input:**
    *   Create a React component for users to input a URL.
    *   Implement a form that submits the URL to the backend `/api/analyze` endpoint.
9.  **Display Basic Analysis Results:**
    *   Create an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/results/:analysisId`) to fetch stored `axe-core` results.
    *   Develop React components to display these results in a simple, readable format (e.g., list of violations with descriptions).

**Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration - Initial Steps**

10. **Research & Define ML Scope:**
    *   Identify specific accessibility issues that `axe-core` might miss or where ML can provide deeper insights (e.g., complex image alt text quality,ARIA usage patterns, keyboard navigation traps not easily caught by automated tools, content structure and readability).
    *   Research existing datasets or strategies for collecting data if custom models are needed.
11. **Setup TensorFlow.js (Backend or separate service):**
    *   Install TensorFlow.js (`@tensorflow/tfjs-node` for Node.js environment if running on the backend).
    *   Explore pre-trained models if applicable or plan for custom model development.
12. **Prototype ML Analysis Module:**
    *   Develop a module that takes website data (e.g., DOM structure, text content, `axe-core` output) as input.
    *   Implement a first ML-driven check (e.g., a simple classifier or pattern recognizer).
    *   Integrate this module into the backend analysis workflow, to be run after or in conjunction with `axe-core`.
13. **Data Aggregation (Initial):**
    *   Modify the backend logic and Firestore document structure to store results from the ML analysis alongside `axe-core` results.

**Phase 5: Enhanced Frontend - Visualizations & Remediation**

14. **Integrate D3.js for Visualizations:**
    *   Install D3.js (`npm install d3` in the React project).
    *   Design and develop React components that use D3.js to create interactive charts and dashboards for key accessibility metrics (e.g., types of errors, severity, trends if historical data is available later).
15. **Develop AI-Powered Remediation Suggestions:**
    *   Start with rule-based suggestions for common `axe-core` violations.
    *   Gradually incorporate ML to provide more nuanced and context-aware suggestions.
    *   Design how suggestions (including code snippets) will be generated and stored.
    *   Display these suggestions in the frontend alongside the issues.

**Phase 6: Disability Experience Simulation**

16. **Design the Simulation Feature:**
    *   Decide on the approach: modifying the live site via a proxy and injecting CSS/JS, or creating a simulated representation.
    *   Define the types of disabilities to simulate (e.g., visual impairments like color blindness, low vision; motor impairments affecting keyboard navigation; cognitive impairments like dyslexia).
17. **Implement Simulation Backend Logic:**
    *   If modifying the live site, this might involve fetching the site content, applying transformations, and serving the modified version.
18. **Implement Simulation Frontend:**
    *   Create UI controls for users to select and experience different simulations.
    *   Display the simulated view.

**Phase 7: Robust API Development**

19. **Expand API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/analyses`: Trigger new analysis (refine existing).
    *   `GET /api/analyses/:id`: Retrieve detailed results of a specific analysis.
    *   `GET /api/analyses?url=...&dateRange=...`: Query analyses for longitudinal tracking.
    *   Endpoints for other data if needed (e.g., specific metrics).
20. **Implement API Authentication (OAuth 2.0):**
    *   Choose an OAuth 2.0 strategy (e.g., using Passport.js with relevant strategies).
    *   Secure API endpoints, allowing access for registered applications or users. This is crucial for CI/CD integration and third-party use.

**Phase 8: Real-time Features & Longitudinal Analytics**

21. **Implement WebSockets (Optional but recommended):**
    *   Install a WebSocket library (e.g., `socket.io`).
    *   Integrate WebSockets to push real-time updates to the frontend dashboards as analysis progresses or new data becomes available.
22. **Develop Longitudinal Analytics Features:**
    *   Backend logic to aggregate data over time for a given URL or user.
    *   Enhance Firestore queries and potentially add new document structures/collections for efficient time-series analysis.
    *   Create frontend components/views to display trends and progress in accessibility scores.

**Phase 9: Comprehensive Testing**

23. **Backend Testing (Jest):**
    *   Write unit tests for controllers, services, and utility functions.
    *   Write integration tests for API endpoints.
24. **Frontend Testing (Jest & React Testing Library):**
    *   Write unit tests for React components.
    *   Write integration tests for user flows.
25. **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Consider tools like Cypress or Playwright for automated E2E tests simulating user interactions across the full stack.

**Phase 10: DevOps & Deployment**

26. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    *   Automate testing, linting, and building on every push/merge.
27. **Containerization (Docker):**
    *   Create `Dockerfile` for the backend Node.js application.
    *   Create `Dockerfile` for the frontend React application (or a multi-stage build for serving static assets via Node/Nginx).
    *   Use `docker-compose.yml` for local development to manage services (backend, frontend, Firebase emulator).
28. **Deployment Strategy:**
    *   Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or PaaS (Heroku, Vercel for frontend).
    *   Deploy containerized applications (e.g., using Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).
    *   Configure environment variables, databases, and networking.

**Phase 11: Documentation, Polish & Iteration**

29. **Documentation:**
    *   API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).
    *   User guides for the website.
    *   Developer documentation for maintainability.
30. **User Feedback & Iteration:**
    *   Gather feedback from early users.
    *   Iteratively improve features, UI/UX, and performance based on feedback.
31. **Monitoring & Maintenance:**
    *   Set up logging and monitoring for the deployed application.
    *   Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities.
