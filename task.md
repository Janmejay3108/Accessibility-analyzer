
Build a comprehensive Web Accessibility Analyzer & Remediation Platform that also includes SEO auditing and optimization features. The platform should help developers improve both the accessibility and SEO of their websites, while also offering a service for developers to request custom website or app development. Below are the detailed requirements and technologies to use:
Project Overview

Purpose: Create a platform that analyzes websites for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 and ADA compliance) and SEO issues, provides AI-powered remediation suggestions, and tracks progress over time.
Additional Goal: Include a feature for developers to request custom website or app development services from the platform.

Tech Stack

Frontend: 
Next.js with TypeScript for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
Tailwind CSS for responsive and accessible styling.
Chart.js for visualizing accessibility and SEO metrics.


Backend: 
Node.js with Express.js to build a RESTful API for handling requests and scans.


Database: 
Firebase (Firestore) for storing scan results, user data, and analytics.


Authentication: 
Google OAuth 2.0 via Firebase Authentication for secure user login and session management.


Accessibility Scanning: 
axe-core for automated WCAG 2.1 and ADA compliance checks.


SEO Auditing: 
Google Lighthouse for auditing SEO metrics (e.g., meta tags, page speed, mobile-friendliness, HTTPS).


AI for Suggestions: 
Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., T5 model) for generating remediation suggestions for accessibility fixes and SEO improvements (e.g., meta descriptions).



Core Features

Accessibility Scanning:

Allow users to input a website URL and scan it for accessibility issues using axe-core.
Display results in an interactive dashboard with Chart.js visualizations (e.g., bar charts for issue types and severity).


SEO Auditing:

Use Google Lighthouse to audit SEO metrics, including meta tags, page speed, mobile-friendliness, and HTTPS.
Present results in the dashboard alongside accessibility metrics.


AI-Powered Remediation Suggestions:

For accessibility issues, generate code snippets and actionable suggestions to resolve violations (e.g., adding alt text).
For SEO, use Hugging Face Transformers to generate meta descriptions, title tags, or other content optimizations.
Identify and highlight fixes that improve both accessibility and SEO (e.g., alt text benefiting screen readers and search engines).


Dashboards:

Build interactive dashboards with Chart.js to display accessibility and SEO metrics.
Include filters (e.g., by severity or category) and sorting options.


Disability Simulation:

Implement a feature to simulate how websites appear to users with disabilities (e.g., color blindness, low vision) using CSS filters and JavaScript.


Progress Tracking:

Store scan results in Firebase Firestore and display progress over time (e.g., line charts showing improvement trends).


Authentication:

Implement Google OAuth 2.0 via Firebase Authentication for secure user login and account management.


Website/App Creation Service:

Add a service request feature (e.g., a contact form or dedicated page) where developers can submit requests for custom website or app development.
Store these requests in Firebase Firestore and provide an admin interface to view them.



Additional Requirements

CI/CD Integration: 
Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment of the platform.


Scheduled Audits: 
Allow users to schedule recurring accessibility and SEO scans (e.g., weekly or monthly).


Educational Resources: 
Include tooltips and links to resources like Googleâ€™s SEO Starter Guide and WCAG documentation to educate users on fixes.


Performance: 
Optimize the platform to efficiently handle large websites, particularly for content extraction and AI summarization.



Call to Action
Build the complete platform by integrating all specified technologies and implementing every feature outlined above. Ensure the platform is user-friendly, fully accessible, and provides actionable insights for accessibility and SEO improvements. Include the website/app creation service feature, allowing developers to request custom development through the platform. Deploy the solution with CI/CD support and ensure it scales effectively for real-world use.
