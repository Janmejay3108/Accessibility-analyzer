1. URL Input:
   A user (or an automated system via the API) provides a URL to the website that needs to be analyzed.

2. Analysis Request:
   2.1. If through the website: The frontend (built with React.js) sends the URL to the   backend (built with Node.js and Express).
   2.2. If through the API: An external system makes a request to the RESTful API endpoint.

3. Automated Scanning:
   The backend system likely uses axe-core (a popular accessibility testing engine) to perform an initial automated scan of the provided URL's content.
4. Machine Learning Analysis:
   The data from the website (and possibly the initial scan results) are then processed by machine learning models (developed with TensorFlow.js). This step likely identifies more complex or nuanced accessibility issues that basic scanners might miss.
5. Data Aggregation & Storage:
   The results from both scanning methods are aggregated. This data, along with historical analysis data for longitudinal tracking, is stored in Firebase/Firestore database with real-time capabilities.
6. Results Presentation & Remediation:

   6.1. The analyzed data is sent back to the frontend.
   6.2. D3.js is used to create real-time visualization dashboards, displaying key   accessibility metrics.
   6.3. AI algorithms generate remediation suggestions, including code snippets, to help fix identified issues.
   6.4. The disability experience simulation feature would allow users to interact with a modified version of the scanned site or a representation of it.

7. Real-time Updates (Potentially):
   Web Sockets might be used to provide real-time updates on the dashboards as the analysis progresses or if new data becomes available.
8. API Access for CI/CD and Analytics:
   The RESTful API exposes endpoints for:
   8.1. Triggering new analyses (useful for CI/CD integration).
   8.2. Retrieving analysis results.
   8.3. Accessing data for longitudinal analytics to track improvements over time.


Technologies Used:
The project leverages a modern tech stack:
Frontend: React.js (UI), D3.js (Data Visualization)
Backend: Node.js, Express (Server-side logic, API)
Database: Firebase/Firestore (NoSQL data storage with real-time capabilities)
Authentication: Firebase Authentication (Integrated auth with Google OAuth support)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js (AI for analysis and suggestions)
Accessibility Engine: axe-core (Automated accessibility scanning)
API: RESTful API (For integration and programmatic access)
Real-time Communication: Firebase real-time listeners (For dashboard updates)
Testing: Jest (JavaScript testing framework)
DevOps: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), Docker (Containerization)
Security: Firebase Security Rules (Database-level security)
In essence, this project aims to be a comprehensive, intelligent, and integrable solution for web accessibility analysis, going beyond simple checks to provide actionable insights and simulations.
